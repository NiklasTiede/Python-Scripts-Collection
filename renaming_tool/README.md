# Renaming Script

Let's you replace whitespaces within file or directory names by underscores. I had a few files containing whitespaces so I thought I could automate this process.

This project was further developed (see [Spasco](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Spasco)) and can now be installed via `pip install spasco`!
