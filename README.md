# Collection of Python Scripts

This is a collection of scripts which are too small to have their own repository but too interesting or useful to rot somewhere on my hard drive. Each directory contains the script and the dependencies are stored within a `requirements.txt` file so that you can easily rebuild them.

List of scripts:

- [Word Cloud](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Python-Scripts-Collection/blob/main/wordcloud/README.md) | Here I generated a word cloud for my [Linux CheatSheet](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/CheatSheet-Linux) repository. It uses the [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) library.

- [Sending Emails](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Python-Scripts-Collection/blob/main/sending_emails/README.md) | Two python scripts for sending emails to yourself or other people.

- [Requesting APIs](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Python-Scripts-Collection/blob/main/requesting_apis/README.md) | Fetching API data is indispensable within the API era. Here I'm using the famous requests library and marshmellow to handle API requests/responds. The data are validated and serialized.
- [Drug Webscraper](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Python-Scripts-Collection/blob/main/drug_webscraper/README.md) | Retrieves the InChI strings of FDA-approved drugs by their proprietary names.
