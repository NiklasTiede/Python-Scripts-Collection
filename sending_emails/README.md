With this script I wanna send some emails from within python!

I am using the built-in library `smtp` and the 3rd party package `yagmail` to send emails.
next goals:

- cron job for sending emails
- sending email if certain condition is fulfilled (web crawler for ebay: a certain product has appeared)
